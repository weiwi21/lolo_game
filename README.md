# Lolo Game

The lolo game is a basic game that is a rough recreation of the the old nintendo game The Adventures of Lolo. The objective is to get treasure. The treasure only opens when all the hearts are gone. Be careful of medusa whose gaze will kill you. You can block her gaze by moving the boxes or snake eggs around.
